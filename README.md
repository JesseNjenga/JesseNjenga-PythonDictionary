Get to know python more about dictionaries with example codes.
In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data structure that allows you to store and access data in key-value pairs.

Each key in the dictionary must be unique and is used to retrieve the associated value. The values in a dictionary can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, lists, and even other dictionaries.

Example:

matatus = {"Name": "Super Metro", "Route": "Kikuyu", "Fleet": 107}
In the above example Keys are name, route & fleet. Values are Super metro, Kikuyu & 107.
You can access the values in a dictionary using the keys.

print(matatus["name"]) #Super Metro
